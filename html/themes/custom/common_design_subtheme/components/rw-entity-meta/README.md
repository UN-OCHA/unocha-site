ReliefWeb Meta
==============

This component provides rules for the "meta" information of articles.

For example the "organization", "posted", "origin" etc. information below the
title of a report article on the `/updates` page.

This also provides the rules for the display of all the "tags" in the sidebar on
article pages.

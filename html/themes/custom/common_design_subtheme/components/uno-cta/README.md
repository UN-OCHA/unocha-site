UNOCHA CTA
=============

This component provides styling for the Call to Action paragraph type.
It displays the full-width of the browser using the cd-bleed component and has a
background colour. When it is the last paragraph in the Custom Content field,
the background colour is removed to prevent a visual conflict with the soft
footer.

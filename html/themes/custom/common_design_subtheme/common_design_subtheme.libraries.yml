# Define Drupal libraries for your custom components.

# These libraries can be referenced in your theme info.yml file to extend or
# override existing base-theme or core Drupal libraries. They can also be
# completely independent and style the custom content of your website, such as
# a custom Paragraph type.

# field is a key part of identifying them in the Admin UI.

# fonts-arabic:
#   label: Arabic

#     theme:

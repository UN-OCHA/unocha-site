We suffer… we can’t do much else but endure,” </em>said Sixta, a 63-year-old homemaker from San Antonio de Flores, in southern Honduras’ Choluteca Department.</p><p>For many families in this rural municipality, which lies several kilometres of dirt roads away from the main roads, their land is everything. Its bounty is often their only source of food and income.</p><p>Rainfall plays an outsized role in the sunbaked community’s fortunes. Whether it rains too little, too late or too much, the results are the same – failed harvests.</p><p>“<em>Since August, it’s been dry… so dry,” </em>Sixta shared solemnly.</p>'

Seasonal rains were expected to help the year’s second harvest (postrera) to yield enough food in November to last until May – providing there was no drought.</p><p>But people in San Antonio de Flores knew a drought was possible when the national civil protection authority issued a municipal drought risk designation in June – a status shared with another 139 of Honduras’ 298 municipalities.</p><p>Unfortunately, September’s rains were nearly half their normal levels for south-central Honduras. Sixta’s son Jorge tends to the family’s field. He explained: “The first season didn’t yield anything; the rainy season started badly. The second season has seen a little more rain, crops look a little more promising. We really need this to work. If we don’t have maize, we have nothing.”</p><p>With the first harvest (primera) faring poorly, the postrera’s success was on everyone’s mind, especially with forecasts that El Niño, linked to decreased rainfall and drier conditions in Central America, will last well into 2024.</p><p>But the fate of the crops was a coin toss, and no one knew how the coin would land.</p>'

Drought hits us so hard. We’ve hardly harvested anything, there was no water,” </em>said the veteran farmer.</p><p>Gregorio, one of the few farmers who also works with livestock, shared a similar outlook.</p><blockquote><p><em>"There were maybe six downpours all season. We’re worried that this harvest won’t be enough. We’re going to have to tighten our belts to make sure we have our food during these months.”&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>These concerns came as 2.3 million Hondurans (one in every five people) are living on the edge of hunger.&nbsp;This is slightly lower than in 2022, but food insecurity remains a serious concern heading into 2024 – a period with a high likelihood of El Niño-induced drought.</p>'

      value: '<p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>By Shakir Elhassan, Communication and Influencing Manager, Care International Sudan&nbsp;</em></p><p>Tens of thousands of people have fled Wad Medani and other parts of Aj Jazirah State after clashes between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in the area on 15 December 2023. Aj Jazirah State and its capital, Wad Medani, were already hosting half a million displaced people that had fled the national capital, Khartoum, after the conflict started between the SAF and RSF in April 2023. Thousands of displaced people from Wad Medani and Aj Jazirah are now sheltering in schools and other public buildings in Kassala.</p><h2><strong>Support for the displaced</strong></h2><p>“Three of my five kids became very sick after a long and hard journey when we fled the fighting in Aj Jazirah and arrived here in this school in Kassala. They were coughing badly and had a high fever. I had no money to take my sick kids to the doctor and I did not know what to do,” said Nahid, a 35-year-old mother of five children. The family was initially displaced to Aj Jazirah from Khartoum when the conflict erupted there on 15 April.&nbsp;</p><p>Another displaced woman sheltering with Nahid at the school advised her to take the children to a nearby clinic supported by CARE International.</p><p>“At the clinic in the Halanaga neighbourhood, a medical doctor examined my kids and told me to do some tests. My children were given some medication after that and I am grateful all that was for free,” explained Nahid.&nbsp;</p><p>Ebtisam Ahmed, Head of Programmes at CARE International in Kassala, said that the number of people recently displaced from Aj Jazirah and other states into Kassala is in thousands and is likely to grow as more people, mainly women and children, arrive every day.&nbsp;</p>'

I was not able to visit the doctor as I had no money.

CARE Sudan provided monthly cash payments to 82 health staff, including medical doctors, nurses, midwives, vaccinators, lab technicians, and pharmacists in four health facilities to prevent any break and impact on the quality of health and nutrition services being provided. &nbsp;</p><p>“Since the beginning of the conflict back in April, we are facing unprecedented challenges in securing the lifesaving medical supplies to operate the clinics,” said Abdelgader Abdelwahab, Health and Nutrition Manager for CARE Sudan in Kassala.&nbsp;</p>'

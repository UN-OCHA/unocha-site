Whether we’re talking to crisis-affected communities, Governments, humanitarian agencies, community-based organizations, the media, donors, the private sector or parties to conflict, we work tirelessly to build coalitions and initiate commitments to save lives and protect those in harm’s way.</p><p>We know that advocacy is as important in the Security Council as it is among local community leaders, and we have a diverse network of advocacy experts who work at every level of our organizational structure. Whether engaging with the media, promoting digital campaigns or engaging in quiet diplomacy with armed groups, we always promote the principles of humanity, neutrality, independence and impartiality, and respect for international law.</p>'

We will continue to push for access to all people and in all areas of Sudan to bring humanitarian supplies and essential services.</p><p><em><strong>To parties to the conflict</strong></em><strong>:</strong> End the fighting. Protect civilians. Grant us safe and unfettered access. Remove bureaucratic impediments. Attacking civilians, looting humanitarian supplies, targeting aid workers, civilian assets and infrastructure, including health centers and hospitals, and blocking humanitarian assistance – all of which have been reported in Sudan – are prohibited under International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law. These acts may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p><p><em><strong>To the international community</strong></em>: There is no excuse for waiting. More than 6 million people in Sudan are one step away from famine. More than 14 million children need humanitarian aid. More than 4 million people have fled the fighting and remain internally displaced across the country and as refugees throughout the wider region. Time is running out for farmers to plant the crops that will feed them and their neighbours. Medical supplies are scarce. The situation is spiralling out of control. Our humanitarian appeals can help some 19 million people in Sudan and neighbouring countries. However, the two appeals are less than 27 per cent funded. Please change that.</p><p>It is time for a reset. We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities. The people of Sudan need peace and equitable access to humanitarian relief. And the international community must step up today, engage at all levels, and act to put Sudan back on track and end the war.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Signatories:</strong></em></p><p><strong>Mr. Martin Griffiths</strong>, Emergency Relief Coordinator and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)</p><p><strong>Dr. QU Dongyu</strong>, Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</p><p><strong>Ms. Sofia Sprechmann Sineiro</strong>, Secretary General, CARE International</p><p><strong>Ms. Shahin Ashraf</strong>, Chair a.i.
